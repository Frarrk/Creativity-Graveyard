        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>Hi!!! My name is Sean Monterero and this is my portfolio!!! (Please like and subscribe and click that bell icon and buy me League of Legends Battlepass).
             I am a first year BSIT student in University of San Carlos, I am an aspiring IT specialist who is trying to see the light at the end of the dark tunnel that is this course.
              I have barely any prior experience to coding before college and I am barely scraping by to finish this website (I wasnt given a coffee budget).
               I hope you, the viewer(!!!!) enjoys reading my wall of texts and hopefully has a bit of a laugh seeing my design (or that you are dissapointed).
            My creativity lies in making things goofy or look "low-effort", anything as long as I had fun making it, because who wants to code while you hate what you do amirite?</p>
