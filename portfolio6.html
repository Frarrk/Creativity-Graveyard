            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Modern computing systems range from compact microcomputers to massive supercomputers. 
                These categories differ in architecture, purpose, and performance. Understanding the 
                hierarchy of computer types helps explain why different industries require different 
                machines customized for their workloads.
            </p>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                Supercomputers offer extreme computational power using massive parallelism, enabling 
                tasks like climate modeling. Mainframes and servers prioritize reliability and large-volume 
                transaction processing, serving banks, enterprises, and governments. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Workstations provide high-performance computing for individual professionals in fields 
                like 3D design and engineering. Microcomputers such as PCs, laptops, and smartphones 
                support everyday personal and office tasks with balanced performance and affordability.
